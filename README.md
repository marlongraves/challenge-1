### Case Study Proposal

    M1 Finance was founded in Chicago 2015 by Brain Barnes and has over 300 employees. M1 is all about 

the investor they have automation tools, product features, and content creation. There are over 60 pre-.

built portfolios to choose from. You can customize your portfolio based on preference, risk, and goals. 

The advantages of investing with M1 are no management fees and attractive margin rate as compared to 

Betterment and SoFi. So far, they have received over 75 million from global investment management like 

Coatue and another 150 million from Softbank.


    Putting more money back into the investor’s pocket is what M1 finances strives to drive fees down.

 zero through automation. While M1 is for anyone sign up it is better suited to the experienced investor,

due to the fact the there are no financial advisors making it more difficult for the novice/ to no 

experience investor. No there is no  M1 utilizes machine learning technology through AUM assets under 

management to seek out how they pick their clients. This works in a cost-effective way without use of a 

person the platform can have customers account and make based on the investing patterns of the 

customer.



   M1 is robo advisor company. Robo advisor has five innovations within the past five years, number one 

is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Which are trends, behavior patterns, and preferences.

Number Two Hybrid Model which are a combination of human and technology working together.

Three Social and Ethical Investing how one’s investing line up one’s belief system. Four Gamification and

Education using badges and levels combined with tools and resources to give a investor experience      

geared towards a younger group. Five Personalization and Customization allows investor to have. 

Portfolios tailored to personal preferences. Companies like Betterment, SoFi, Ally Bank, Blooom etc. 

Considered to be robo-advisor fintechs. M1 has started out from 1 billion and has grown to 6 billion.

Online trading. low to zero management fees are some of the metrics that I found. M1 unfortunately 

Is not performing nearly to its counterparts with a one and a half stars from the Better Business

Bureau and numerous complaints from former customers. M1 seems to have bad business practices.

I would offer personal advisory/planning, making sure my service meets customer satisfaction and if.

Not satisfied making their money is returned to them which was one of the complaints I read.

Offering personal advisor/planning would help reassure new customers their putting their money

In the right place. Its also develops trust and accountability with customer. M1 also could expand it’s

Product line to include bonds, mutual funds, futures, and options trading. Provide these additional 

Services and tools would quickly make M1 a force to be reckoned with.
